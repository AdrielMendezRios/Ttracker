Overall Architecture

Your architecture is well-structured with clear separation of concerns:
Scanner interface defines what a language parser should implement
Manager handles selecting the appropriate parser
Go parser implements Scanner for Go files
PluginManager handles external parsers
Store handles data storage and retrieval

Issues and Improvements

Issue in Go Parser Detection Logic:
Your go_parser.go only checks for "todo" using strings.Contains(strings.ToLower(c.Text), "todo"), but doesn't check for related keywords like "FIXME", "BUG", etc.

It also might find false positives if "todo" appears as part of another word.

Missing Functionality in findEnclosingFunction:
The current implementation only checks for function declarations, but TODOs might appear in methods of structs or interface implementations.
It only checks if the comment is inside the function body but misses TODOs in function parameters or return types.

External Parser Interface Limitations:
The ExternalParser.ParseFile method assumes a very specific output format from external parsers (<lineNumber>: <comment>).
There's no way for external parsers to provide the function name where the TODO was found.

Missing documentation on how external parsers should be implemented or how their output should be formatted.

Error Handling in scan.go:
In RunScan function, errors from mgr.GetParser(path) are silently ignored. This might hide issues with file extensions.
Errors from parser.ParseFile(path) are logged but don't affect the overall scan.

Path Handling for Plugin Config:
Although you've fixed this in track.go, the paths for plugin configuration and store files seem to be hardcoded and might not work in all environments.

Missing Initialization Checks:
The NewPluginManager function doesn't check if the directory for the plugin config exists before trying to read it.

No Support for Ignoring Directories:
There's no way to specify directories to ignore during scanning (like node_modules, .git, etc.).

No Test Cases for Manager and Scanner:
While you've created a test for the Go parser, there are no tests for the Manager, PluginManager, or the overall scan process.

Configuration Issue in track.go:
The code saves the relative path in the config (cfg.Projects[name] = dir) but uses the absolute path for scanning.

Missing Documentation:
The code lacks comprehensive documentation, especially for implementing custom parsers.
Recommendations

Improve TODO detection in Go Parser:
Use regex to better detect TODO comments and include common patterns like "FIXME", "BUG", etc.
Add support for extracting priority or assignee from TODO comments (e.g., "TODO(high): Fix this" or "TODO(@username): Implement feature").

Enhance Function Detection:
Improve the findEnclosingFunction method to handle methods, interfaces, and TODOs outside function bodies.

Better External Parser Integration:
Create a more flexible format for external parser output, possibly using JSON.
Add documentation and examples for implementing custom parsers.

Improve Error Handling:
Better error handling in the scan process to provide more useful feedback.
Consider adding a logging framework instead of using fmt.Printf directly.

Add Configurability:
Allow users to configure which directories to ignore during scanning.
Make TODO patterns configurable.

Create More Tests:
Add tests for Manager, PluginManager, and the overall scan process.

Fix Path Handling:
Consistently use absolute paths in the configuration and scanning process.

Add Documentation:
Add comprehensive documentation, especially for implementing custom parsers.
Would you like me to implement any of these improvements to your codebase?
